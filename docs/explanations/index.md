# Explanations

These are developer-focused explanations of internal pylcm mechanisms. They are designed
for contributors and advanced users who want to understand how pylcm works under the
hood.

- [Parameters Workflow](params_workflow.ipynb) — How to specify parameters at model,
  regime, and function levels.
- [Function Representation](function_representation.ipynb) — What the function
  representation does and how it works.
- [Dispatchers](dispatchers.ipynb) — How pylcm's dispatchers work.
- [Interpolation and Extrapolation](interpolation.ipynb) — How pylcm's
  coordinate finders and `map_coordinates` handle interpolation and extrapolation across
  grid types.
