    "# The Function Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we showcase how the function representation of a set of values\n",
    "pre-calculated on a grid is used in `lcm`, and how it works. Before we dive into the\n",
    "details, let us consider what it does on a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the last period of a finite dynamic programming problem. The value function\n",
    "array for this period corresponds to the solution of a classic static utility\n",
    "maximization problem. That is, it is the maximum of concurrent utility in each state,\n",
    "where the maximum is taken over actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the state-space is discretized into states $(x_1, \\ldots, x_p)$, the value function\n",
    "array (in the last period) $V^\\text{arr}_T$ is a $p$-dimensional array, where the $i$-th\n",
    "entry $V^\\text{arr}_{T, i} = V^\\text{arr}_T(x_i)$ is the maximal utility the agent can\n",
    "achieve in state $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now the Bellman equation for the second-to last period:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{T-1}(x) =\n",
    "    \\max_{a} \\left\\{u(x, a) + \\mathbb{E}_{T-1}\\left[V_T(x') \\mid x, a\\right] \\right\\},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ denotes the action, and $x', x$ denote the next and current state,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most solution algorithms, we will need to evaluate the function $V_T$ at a different\n",
    "set of points than the pre-calculated grid points in $V^\\text{arr}_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would like to have a function in the code that we can treat like $V_T$ is\n",
    "written in the equation above: a function that can be evaluated at any valid state $x$,\n",
    "ignoring the discretization in $V^\\text{arr}_T$. This is precisely what the function\n",
    "representation does.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a function representation of pre-calculated values on a grid (i.e. an array)\n",
    "we need to take care of the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function will be called with named arguments. Hence, we need to know which\n",
    "   argument name corresponds to which array dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function will be called with values of each dimension (e.g., health taking on a\n",
    "   value of 3). However, array elements are retrieved through indexing (maybe an index\n",
    "   of 1 corresponds to a value of 3 for health).  Hence. we require a mapping from\n",
    "   levels to indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Continuous variables will take on values that do not occur in the grid. This requires\n",
    "   interpolation of the function values found on that grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the above allows us to create a function representation of pre-calculated\n",
    "values on a grid, which behaves like an analytical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we use the terminal (retired) regime of a simple two-regime\n",
    "consumption-savings model. This regime has a single continuous state (wealth) and a\n",
    "single continuous action (consumption), making it ideal for demonstrating how the\n",
    "function representation works. We use a coarse linearly-spaced wealth grid (10 points)\n",
    "to clearly show the interpolation behavior (of course, with a CRRA/log utility function,\n",
    "one would usually use a log-spaced grid here)."

    "internals of the function representation work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by listing the required steps. The general idea is to generate functions for\n",
    "the array lookup, interpolation, and so on, with the correct signature signaling their\n",
    "dependence structure. These can then be combined into a single function that performs\n",
    "all necessary steps using `dags.concatenate_functions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add functions to look up positions of discrete state variables given their labels\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the above example model there are no discrete state variables, so we can skip this\n",
    "   step. If there are discrete variables, the lookup functions will coincide with the\n",
    "   identity function, as the variables themselves are indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the lookup function for the discrete part\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this step, a function is generated that allows one to index into the\n",
    "   pre-calculated value function array using the labels of the discrete\n",
    "   state variables. In the above example model, there are no discrete state variables,\n",
    "   so this function returns the value function array untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create interpolation functions for the continuous state variables\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the model contains (dense) continuous state variables, interpolation functions\n",
    "   are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Add a coordinate finder for each continuous state variable\n",
    "      \n",
    "      This allows us to map values of the continuous variable into their corresponding\n",
    "      (general) indices, as required by the interpolator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Add an interpolator\n",
    "\n",
    "      The interpolator uses the general indices from the last step, to interpolate on\n",
    "      the values of the state variable at the corresponding grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Throwing everything into dags\n",
    "\n",
    "  The last step is to throw everything into `dags.concatenate_functions`. The resulting\n",
    "  function is a value function that behaves like an analytical function.\n",
