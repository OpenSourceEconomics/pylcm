"""One-asset consumption--saving toy with a continuous tax-bracket kink.

A minimal model exercising the continuous-budget BQSEGM path: a single liquid
asset, a single consumption action, and a piecewise-affine tax that bends
cash-on-hand at an exemption threshold. Below the exemption the tax is zero, above
it the marginal tax `tax_rate` applies, so `coh(liquid)` is continuous with a
single downward kink — no jump. The brute variant evaluates the schedule on a
dense grid and is the agreement oracle; the BQSEGM variant reads the declared
schedule and solves each affine segment by EGM.
