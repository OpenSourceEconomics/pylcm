"""The built-in regime solvers.

`GridSearch` (the default) runs the existing max-Q-over-a grid search;
`DCEGM` is a published configuration whose engine is not yet wired in, so a
regime requesting it is rejected at model build by its `validate`. Both are
`Solver` subclasses. The kernel-building imports (`jax`, `get_max_Q_over_a`)
are function-local so the public `lcm.solvers` façade stays a thin re-export
that pulls in no numerical engine modules.

    DC-EGM inverts the Euler equation on an exogenous end-of-period
    (post-decision) grid instead of searching a dense grid for the continuous
    action. It requires a specific model structure — exactly one continuous
    (*Euler*) state and one continuous action, a declared resources function
    `R` with consumption recovery `c = R - A`, a post-decision function `A`,
    and an `inverse_marginal_utility` regime function — which is validated at
    `Model` construction time.

    The configuration is published so a model can name the solver and its
    parameters, but the solver engine is not yet wired in: `validate` rejects a
    regime requesting it. `GridSearch` is the only available solver.

    Forward simulation works but is *grid-restricted*: `simulate` recomputes
    the argmax over the regime's gridded continuous action against the
    stored value function, rather than interpolating the exact EGM policy.
    Simulated continuous actions therefore live on the action grid, and with
    taste shocks the simulated choice frequencies follow the grid-restricted
    choice-specific values, not exactly the solve's choice probabilities.
    The budget constraint the solve enforces intrinsically
    (`continuous_action <= resources - savings_grid lower bound`) is applied
    as a feasibility mask during simulation.
