"""Epstein-Zin EGM kernel — closed-form consumption inversion and value update.

The recursive value satisfies
`V = [(1-beta) q^(1-rho) + beta nu^(1-rho)]^(1/(1-rho))`, where `q` is the period
flow, `rho` the inverse elasticity of intertemporal substitution, `beta` the
discount factor, and `nu` the certainty equivalent of the next-period value over
the joint continuation lottery (`PowerMean.aggregate`).

Conditional on `nu` and its end-of-period-savings derivative `dnu/ds`, the
first-order condition `(1-beta) q^(-rho) q_c = beta nu^(-rho) dnu/ds` inverts for
consumption in closed form whenever `q^(-rho) q_c` is a single power of `c` — the
basic single-good flow and the fixed-service Cobb-Douglas flow both qualify. The
inversion carries the certainty equivalent's savings derivative directly, so it
retains the savings-dependent transition-probability and nonlinear next-resource
terms that a policy-only formula would drop.
