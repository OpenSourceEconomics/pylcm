r"""Certified sign of the difference of two affine value lines.

Upper-envelope construction is a sequence of *structural* decisions — which link
owns a cell, whether two links cross inside it, whether a crossing coincides with
a node. A magnitude-scaled tolerance cannot make those decisions: it is not
invariant to a common additive value level, so it masks a strictly better branch
whenever values sit on a large constant, and it promotes a below-envelope
crossing after the same shift.

This module decides them from the sign of the exact difference instead. For two
links given by their endpoints the value at `x` is

```{math}
A(x) = \frac{a_{v0}(a_{x1} - x) + a_{v1}(x - a_{x0})}{a_{x1} - a_{x0}},
```

so with positive widths the sign of `A(x) - B(x)` is the sign of the
cross-multiplied determinant

```{math}
D = N_a w_b - N_b w_a .
```

`D` is evaluated in the double-double arithmetic of `double_double`, whose
error-free transforms are exact. The only inexactness is the low-order tail each
renormalization discards, and that tail is captured exactly and accumulated into
a `dropped` bound. Two properties follow, and they are what the envelope relies
on:

- `dropped` is exactly zero whenever the whole evaluation was exact, so a genuine
  tie (a crossing sitting exactly on a node, or a link compared with itself) is
  *certified* rather than inferred from a threshold;
- otherwise the true determinant is within `dropped` of the computed one, so a
  sign is published only when it is certain.

Two things can stop a sign being published, and they are not the same, so they
are reported apart:

- `BELOW_RESOLUTION_SIGN` — the determinant was computed, but it is smaller than
  its own error bound. The links are then within a rounding of each other, so no
  state between them is demonstrably better and a caller may choose either,
  provided it chooses deterministically.
- `UNRESOLVED_SIGN` — no determinant worth reading was produced at all: an input
  was non-finite, a product left the range where the transforms are exact, or the
  shared scaling flattened a link that had positive width in the caller's units.
  Nothing follows about the geometry, which may be far apart, so a caller must
  fail loud rather than choose.

Collapsing the two would be a fail-open: the second case is exactly the one where
a large true margin can be reported as no margin. Callers must mask dead
candidates and zero-width links before calling: a link of zero width has no
affine value line, and this predicate does not invent one.

Correctness is the design constraint here, not throughput: one comparison costs a
few hundred flops. The evaluation is branch-free and elementwise, so it stays
`jax.jit`- and `jax.vmap`-compatible with static shapes.
