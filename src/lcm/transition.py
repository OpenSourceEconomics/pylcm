"""User-facing transition wrappers: `MarkovTransition`.

A thin leaf module — the class definition only, with no dependency on
`Regime`, the validators, or the regime-building code. Keeping the type here
lets the user-facing `Regime`, the engine-internal regime-building code, and
the regime validators all import it without an import cycle.

    Wrap a transition function in `MarkovTransition` to indicate that it returns
    a probability distribution over next states (for state transitions) or over
    next regimes (for regime transitions), rather than a deterministic next value.

    Use at both the state and regime level:

        # Stochastic regime transition
