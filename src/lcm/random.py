    """Generate pseudo-random number generator keys (PRNG keys) for simulation.

    PRNG keys in JAX are immutable objects used to control random number generation.
    A key can be used to generate a stream of random numbers, e.g., given a key, one can
    call jax.random.normal(key) to generate a stream of normal random numbers. In order
    to ensure that each simulation is based on a different stream of random numbers, we
    split the key into one key per initial state for each stochastic variable,
    and one key that will be passed to the next iteration in order to generate new keys.

    See the JAX documentation for more details:
    https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/random-numbers.html#random-numbers-in-jax

    Args:
        key: Random key.

        n_initial_states: Number of initial states.

    Returns:
        - Updated random key.
        - Dict with random keys for each id in ids.
