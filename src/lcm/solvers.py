"""User-facing solver configuration classes.

A regime's `solver` field selects the algorithm used for that regime during
backward induction:

- `BruteForce()` (the default): grid search over the full state-action product.
- `DCEGM(...)`: the endogenous grid method for discrete-continuous choice
  (Iskhakov, Jørgensen, Rust & Schjerning 2017, Quantitative Economics 8(2),
  317-365, [doi:10.3982/QE643](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE643)).

These classes are pure configuration — no callables, no engine internals. The
engine dispatches on `type(regime.solver)` through the private builder
registry in `_lcm.solution.registry`.

    DC-EGM inverts the Euler equation on an exogenous end-of-period
    (post-decision) grid instead of searching a dense grid for the continuous
    action. It requires a specific model structure — exactly one continuous
    (*Euler*) state and one continuous action, a declared resources function
    `R` with consumption recovery `c = R - A`, a post-decision function `A`,
    and an `inverse_marginal_utility` regime function — which is validated at
    `Model` construction time.

    Forward simulation works but is *grid-restricted*: `simulate` recomputes
    the argmax over the regime's gridded continuous action against the
    stored value function, rather than interpolating the exact EGM policy.
    Simulated continuous actions therefore live on the action grid, and with
    taste shocks the simulated choice frequencies follow the grid-restricted
    choice-specific values, not exactly the solve's choice probabilities.
    The budget constraint the solve enforces intrinsically
    (`continuous_action <= resources - savings_grid lower bound`) is applied
    as a feasibility mask during simulation.
